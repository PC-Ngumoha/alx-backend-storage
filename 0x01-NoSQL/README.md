# NoSQL (MongoDB)

## Useful Points:

- _ACID_ stands for _Atomicity Consistency Isolation Durability_ and this trait is not always guaranteed in NoSQL databases.

- Categories of NoSQL databases include the following:
	- Key-Value data stores.
	- Document stores.
	- Wide-column stores.
	- Graph stores.

- _BSON_ stands for _Binary Javascript Object Notation_ and it is essentially a binary-encoded serialization of JSON objects. They are the mechanisms that enable NoSQL databases store their data behind the scenes.
